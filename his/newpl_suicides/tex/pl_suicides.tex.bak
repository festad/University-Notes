\title{Analysis on suicides in Poland}

\begin{document} 

\maketitle

\section{Introduction}
%
The data used in this analysis come from the website of the Polish National
Police, available at 
\url{https://statystyka.policja.pl/st/wybrane-statystyki/zamachy-samobojcze}. 
The data are divided into three ranges of years: from 1999 to 2012,
from 2013 to 2016 and from 2017 to 2023, some discrepancies in the format
were inevitably present and fortunately easy to fix.
In every range of years, the data are provided in different excel files,
each file focusing on a different aspect,
here follows a list of the files in each range of years.
\begin{itemize}
\item Age range (grupa wiekowa) and day of the week (dzień tegodnia)(the day of the week is not 
treated in this writing).
\item Place where the deed took place (miejsce popełnienia), also containing
the subdivision into men (w tym mężczyzn) and women (w tym kobiet),
unfortunately the subdivision is not made for every place where 
the corpse was found but it only regards the total values.
\item Method used (sposób popełnienia), 
reason for the deed  (powód popełnienia), the two \textit{variables}
are treated separately, e.g. it is not possible to know how many people
that committed suicide for a specific reason adopted a specific method.
Again, this file contains the same information on the sex of the victim but
this information is not reported for every specific reason or method.
\item Civil status (stan cywilny), education (wykształcenie),
job (informacja o pracy/nauce), these \textit{variables} are treated
separately and the same goes for the information on sex.
\end{itemize}
The 4 files are published in couples: one reports the information on
attempted suicides (zamachy samobójcze) and the other reports 
the attempted suicides resulting in death (zamachy samobłicze zakończone
zgonem).
Other data regarding the source of income (żrodło utrzymania),
state of consciousness (stan świadomości),
mental state (stan psychiczny) and criminal history (przeszłość karna)
are available but they are not treated in this article. \\
Each of these files displays data by rows, where every row focuses on a specific country
and a specific year, this format is not the one commonly adopted and referred to as
\textit{tabluar data}, where every variable is a column.

\section{Global view}
The data on the suicides in the last 20 years are displayed in the following two images.

\begin{figure}[h!]

		\caption{The ratio of the suicides resulting in death over the total number of attempts}
	\end{minipage}
\end{figure}
The abrupt increase just before 2013 is due to to a technical 
reason rather than a real incre in the number of suicides,
as reported on the main page of the website:
\begin{quote}
	\textit{Since 2013, the method of collecting and generating statistical data 
	on suicide attempts has changed. Currently, data are entered into KSIP via 
	form KSIP 10 – “Registration of a suicide attempt report” immediately after 
	the event at the moment it is determined that a suicide attempt has occurred. 
	Additionally, the system “freezes” the data with a one-month delay, allowing 
	for modifications in cases where it is determined at a later stage of the 
	procedure that a suicide attempt did not occur.}
\end{quote}
The change in how attempted suicides are reported might explain why, from around 2015, 
the trend of attempted suicides shows a different behaiviour
that does not resemble the one of the trend of fatal suicides.  \\ \\
%
%
An unfortunate increment between 2012 and 2013 in the number of fatal suicides cannot be simply justified
by the technical reason reported above. \\
%
%
% INCOME
%
One quantity whose trend might be relevant to compare to that of the suicides
is the income but, as shown in the following graphs, it does not seem to bring
relevant information since it is (fortunately) only increasing during the years.
%
%
% EMPLOYMENT
%
Another possibly relevant quantity is the employment ratio, unfortunately the only available data
start from 2010. The naive assumption initially made is that people aged between 30 and 50 are more likely
to commit suicide because of unemployment. The increase of suicides between 2012 and 2013 is 
present also for that range of age and it looks correlated to the decrease in the employment
ratio.
It is interesting to compare how suicides increased for all the ranges of age available to 
discover which categories were affected the most.
It is also interesting to see how people working in different areas committed suicide during the years
to look for correlations with the employment ratio.
%
%The following graphs report the trend of the average income, the trend of the employment, 
%the trend of suicides committed by people aged between 30 and 50,
%the trend of fatal suicides committed by people among
%the age between 19 and 34 (more likely to commit suicide because of unemployment) and the trend of fatal
%suicides divided by their job.

%
The employment ratio decreases between 2012 and 2013 and in the same period,
unemployed people in particular, committed more suicides, then between 2019 and 2020 
the employment ratio decreases while suicides among unemployed people increases.
%
It is important to notice that, when it comes to age groups, none of them shows a decrease between 
2012 and 2013.
Between 2013 and 2014 the situation generally improves. \\
Between 2019 and 2020 another decrease in the employment ratio took place but, in this
case, the increase in the number of suicides is not as significant as the one between 2012 and 2013,
moreover, only few age groups show an increase in the number of suicides. 
Between 2020 and 2021, when the employment ratio increases, there is no significant improvement,
on the contrary, the number of people aged between 45 and 49, between 55 and 59 and between 70 and 74 
increased whereas it decreased between 2019 and 2020.
The enormous increase in the number of suicides between 2012 and 2013 is likely to be the consequence 
of a more complex phenomenon rather than just the decrease in the employment ratio.

%
% On the other hand, when focusing on people among the age between 19 and 34, although the 
% number of suicides increases a lot between 2012 and 2013, no significant increase happens between 2019 and 
% 2020, moreover, the number of total suicides (displayed in the first graph) between 2019 and 2020 decreased,
% this suggests that either the decrease of the employment ratio during 2019 and 2020 was less impactful
% or that the decrease of the employment ratio between 2012 and 2013 was part of a more complex phenomenon. \\
% It is still worth noting that between 2012 and 2013 most suicides were committed by people aged between 50 and 59,
% then people in that range of age slowly decreased the number of suicides while younger people increased them:
% 
% 
%I would say that people aged between 50 and 59 would be more likely to commit suicide due to an
%economic crisis. What surprises is that the increase between 2012 and 2013 was even worse than that between
%2007 and 2008, the period of the great financial crisis.

\section{Analysis on the single variables}
%
\subsection{Age}
%Analysis on age.
As shown in figures \ref{fig:age_attempted}, 
\ref{fig:age_fatal}, \ref{fig:age_foa},
the ranges of age that show the most worrying increment in attempted suicides 
are the youngest ones, whereas the oldest ones keep a slightly increasing trend and 
appear to be less affected by the economic crisis.
People aged over 40 and under 70 are the ones to commit the most fatal suicides and aare those
who show the most significant increment between 2012 and 2013.
Older people are the more likely to unfortunately succeed in their attempt and younger people
are the least likely to do so, the difference in this ratio of fatal over attempted suicides 
increased in time.
%
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}

        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imgs/age_fatal.pdf}
        \caption{Trend of fatal suicides by age range}
	\label{fig:age_fatal}
    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{imgs/age_foa.pdf}
    \caption{Trend of fatal over attempted suicides by age range}
    \label{fig:age_foa}
\end{figure}
%
The heatmap in figure \ref{fig:age_foa_heat} confirms that for younger people the ratio of fatal over 
attempted suicides improved (decreased) in time more than it happened for older people.
Figure \ref{fig:age_city_att_op-991020} shows that from 1999 to 2020 there was not a significant 
change in how people from different age ranges attempted suicide in different cities,
what is revealed from a first look at the yougest range is that Gdańsk was the city with the
smalles number of teenagers attempting suicide in 1999 and became the one with the most
teenagers attempting suicide in 2020, whereas in 2015 Opole had a lot more younger people
attempting suicide with respect to other cities. 
There seem not to be an apparent trend that might suggest 
whether a city needs more prevention programs than others.
When focusing on more recent years (2021 and 2022), as in figure \ref{fig:age_city_att_op-2122},
apart from noticing again the general increase in the percentages of suicides attempted by
the youngest, it becomes more concerning how again Gdańsk displayes
the greatest percentage of the youngest attempting suicide, this disproves
the previous naive conclusion: some serious investigation should be made
about why so many teenagers attempt suicide in Gdańsk.

Figures \ref{fig:age_city_op-att-2022}
and \ref{fig:age_city_op-fat-2022}
show that
the place where most people attempted suicide in 2022 is Katowice, 
in particular youngest people, when focusing on fatal suicides 
also Radom and Rzeszów appear to be problematic places.
The least sad city appears to be Warszawa.

\subsection{Sex}
Figures \ref{fig:sex_attempted}, \ref{fig:sex_fatal}, \ref{fig:sex_foa}
show that the two trends of attempted and fatal suicides for males and females
are quite similar up until 2013, with less abrupt changes for females but still
increasing and decreasing in the same years men did, then a worrying trend of attempted 
suicides of women starts in 2017 and it unfortunately reflects in an increment
in the number of fatal suicides of women starting from 2018 while men show a decrease.
It is important to remark that the condition of women in Poland still needs to be improved,
unfortunately different political choices in the last years did not help \footnotemark{}:
\begin{quote}
\textit{The court removed the right to abortions because of birth defects, 
which had accounted for more than 90\% of all abortions. Since January 2021, 
abortion has been allowed only in cases of rape, incest or when a mother's 
health is in danger.}

    \caption{Heatmap of fatal over attempted suicides by sex}
    \label{fig:sex_foa_heat}
\end{figure}
%
%
Figure \ref{fig:sex_foa_heat} shows that in general women are less likely to commit
suicide when attempting.
%
From figure \ref{fig:sex_city_att_suicides-991020} it is not easy to spot a city in particular
where disparity between women and men is more present than in others,
Białystok, Szczecin and Warszawa are among the cities with a higher percentage
of women attempting suicide, the peak in Łódż in 2020 does not seem to be part of a trend.
Figure \ref{fig:sex_city_att_suicides-2122} shows that women's condition in Łódż worsened,
but the most problematic city became Gdańsk.
Figures \ref{fig:sex_city_fat_suicides-991020} and \ref{fig:sex_city_fat_suicides-2122}
seem to contradict the sad situation for women in Gdańsk and suggest that Warszawa
has become the wort place for women to live, but in actuality what the barplots tell is
that in Warszawa it is more likely that women end up dead when attempting suicide,
this does not suggest by any means that Gdańsk has less serious social issues that lead
to depression.
Figure \ref{fig:sex_foa_city-2122} shows that the places where women are more likely to die 
when attempting 
suicide are Bydgoszcz and Warszawa but, similarly to what suggested above, 
this is independent from sex since those two cities are also the places where males are
more likely to end up dead when attempting suicide.
It is worth to investigate why in Gdańsk there were so many suicide attempts from women.

\subsection{Place}
%
%
Figures \ref{fig:place_attempted}, \ref{fig:place_fatal}, \ref{fig:place_foa},
reveal that the most common place where people in Poland attempt suicide is 
home, then other common places are farms, basements and forests,
suicides committed in farms decreased in time, whereas suicides at home,
on the street and on railways increased.
The places where more suicide attempts resulted fatal were farms,
basements, forests and legal isolations.

%
The heatmap in figure \ref{fig:place_foa_heat} confirms that 
suicide attempts inside farms, basements and forests kept a higher fatal outcome
rate whereas those in the apartment decreased during the years, suicide attempts in schools
are documented only starting from 2017 and fortunately they often do not result in death.
The row relative to military shows abrupt gradients because of the small number of cases,
the only time when more than 2 attempts of suicide happened was in 2012 in Lublin (3 attempts, 0 resulted
in death).

The barplots in \ref{fig:place_city_att_suicides-991020}
does not reveal particular differences among different cities,
and neither do those in \ref{fig:place_city_att_suicides-2122},
barplots in \ref{fig:place_city_fat_suicides-991020} and \ref{fig:place_city_fat_suicides-2122}
confirm that among suicides resulting in a fatal outcome those committed in the apartment
are less predominant than they are when considering suicide attempts in general.

\subsection{Way}
The figures \ref{way_attempted}, \ref{way_fatal}, \ref{way_foa}
The most common method to commit suicide in Poland is by hanging,
then follows an increasing trend in suicide attempts by taking pills,
then by self harm and throwing from height.
The majority of suicide attempts that resulted in a fatal outcome are 
again by hanging, then by throwing from height (suggesting that taking pills
is not an effective method).
In Poland, what resulted as the most effective methods to commit suicide
are by shooting and hanging, the least effective methods are by self harm
and taking pills.
Unfortunately data about attempted suicides in general are available only after 2013,
whereas data on suicides resulting in death are available since 1999.

Figure \ref{way_foa_heat}, similarly to the previous one, does not show any
evolution in the effectiveness of suicide methods.

\end{figure}
Figures \ref{way_city_att_suicides-131722} and \ref{way_city_fat_suicides-131722}  
show that suicide attempts by taking pills increased in all cities,
in Gdańsk and Łódż in 2022 they were even more than suicide attempts by hanging,
in the section focusing on sex it was shown that a great number of female 
attempted suicide in Gdańsk, this might suggest that taking pills is a popular
method among females, a similar reasoning can be applied to suicide attempts by self harm,
however, such speculations cannot be proved, such correlation could be motivated
by a hidden variable that is not easy to uncover.
An argument against this hypothesis could simply be that suicide attempts by taking 
pills increased in percentage in all the cities and not just Gdańsk or Łodż.

in death and Radom with the greates number of cases by population: 156 every 100000.
The most affected cities are Katowice, Rzeszow, Radom and Olsztyn.

\subsection{Reason}
%
%
Figures \ref{reason_attempted}, \ref{reason_fatal}, \ref{reason_foa}
show that the most common reason for attempting suicide 
is mental illness, followed by hearbreak and family problems.
When considering fatal suicide attempts, mental illness is the reason 
that increased the most, although this might be regarded as a reason lead to
by other reasons, this is way it is not easy to decide what are the social
diseases to work on to decrease as much as possible the phenomenon of suicides.
Suicide attempts because of school/work problems are unfortunately increasing: in 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023
they were respectively 159, 240, 313 and 322.
The reason that caused the highest fatality ratio is physical illness, followed by disability,
loss of health and committing a crime, interestingly enough none of the most common reason for attempting
suicide is among the ones with highest fatality ratio.
Unfortunately, only data about fatal suicide attempts are available since 1999,
data about all attempts are available only since 2013.

\end{figure}
%
%
In figures \ref{reason_city_att_suicides-131722} and \ref{reason_city_fat_suicides-131722}
it is shown that family problems, physical illness and poor economical conditions 
decreased as the percentage of all reasons that lead to suicide (both attempted and fatal suicides),
mental illness and school/work problems on the other hand increased.
\begin{figure}[h!]

    \label{reason_city_fat_suicides-131722}
\end{figure}
In figures \ref{reason_city_op-att-2022} and \ref{reason_city_op-fat-2022}
it is again confirmed that mental illness is the most common reason for attempting
suicide and that Katowice, Rzeszow and Radom are the most problematic.

	\label{reason_city_op-fat-2022}
    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Status}
As shown in figures \ref{status_attempted} and \ref{status_fatal},
the majority of people attempting suicide were single, then married.
Regarding suicides with a fatal outcome, after 2014, the numbers decreased for married
people and increased for single people.
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imgs/status_attempted.pdf}
        \caption{Trend of attempted suicides by civil status }
	\label{status_attempted}
    \end{minipage}
    \hfill
    \begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imgs/status_fatal.pdf}
        \caption{Trend of fatal suicides by civil status }
	\label{status_fatal}
    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}
In all cases, the fatality of the attempts seems to have been decreasing, again,
this is not because of a decreasing \textit{determination} when committing the act,
but rather because many more cases have been registered as attempted during the last years,
and this could be justified by the technical reason epxlained at the beginning of the document.
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{imgs/status_foa.pdf}
    \caption{Trend of fatal over attempted suicides by civil status }
\end{figure}

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{imgs/status_foa_heat.pdf}
    \caption{Heatmap of fatal over attempted suicides by civil status }
\end{figure}
By what is shown in figure \ref{status_city_att_suicides-2122}
the first thing that can be noticed is the peak in the percentage of
single people attempting suicide in Gdańsk in 2021, 2022 and 2023,
with a similar reasoning to the one made regarding suicide attempts
by taking pills in Gdańsk, it could be investigated whether single
women are more likely to commit suicide; if that was the case then 
it could make sense to investigate whether heartbreak was a major reason
for attempting suicide in the last years but Gdańsk does not display any relevant
peak in \ref{reason_city_att_suicides-131722}, this could either mean that 
single women are more likely to commit suicide but not because of 
a heartbreak or that the correlation is simply coincidential or caused
by a hidden variable.

Figures \ref{status_city_op-att-2022} and \ref{status_city_op-fat-2022}
confirm that the the majority of the cases of suicide attempts are committed
by single and married people.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Education}
The plots \ref{fig:education_attempted}, \ref{fig:education_fatal} and
\ref{fig:education_foa}
show an unprecedent behaviour: the attempted suicides 
people with a basic, medium or technical/professional education decreased until 2011 and then
increased. The trend in the suicide attempts with a fatal outcome decreased
until 2011 for the previous categories (which are also the three with the greatest numbers)
but did not increase after.
The reason of the dissimilarity between the trends focusing on education and the more general
ones such as those focusing on sex (\ref{fig:sex_attempted})
or on total values (\ref{fig:poland_general})
is that the cases labeled with an education level are the minority,
as an example, in 2022 there were 14520 suicide attempts, 9421 of which,
were not labeled with any education.
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imgs/education_attempted.pdf}
        \caption{Trend of attempted suicides by education }

%    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{imgs/education_foa_heat.pdf}

From the barplots representing the percentage of each education level
in the different cities (
\ref {fig:education_city_att_suicides-991020},
\ref {fig:education_city_att_suicides-2122},
\ref {fig:education_city_fat_suicides-991020},
\ref {fig:education_city_fat_suicides-2122})
it is not easy to spot any relevant trend that could suggest that a city
has a higher scholarization leven than another, and even if the plots
had shown a trend, it would have still been needed a further investigation
given that the majority of the cases were not labeled with an education level.

    \label{fig:education_city_fat_suicides-2122}
\end{figure}

Figures \ref{fig:education_city_op-att-2022} and \ref{fig:education_city_op-fat-2022}
again show that, in 2022, basic, medium and technical/professional education were the most common
among the few labeled cases and that Katowice had the greatest number of suicide attempts by population,
on the other hand Rzeszów had the greatest number of fatal suicide attempts by population.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Job}
As it happened for the data on education levels,
the majority of suicide cases were not labeled with the 
job of the victim, because of this, a complete analysis on
the reasons that lead to suicide is not possible.
In figure \ref{fig:job_attempted} and \ref{fig:job_fatal}
most of the people that committed suicide were unemployed,
as argued in the first part of the document,
the reason could be the decrease in the employment ratio
(or it could be another reason that lead to both phenomenons).
The most concerning trend is that of suicide attempts of elementary students
(uczeń, that is, students in primary and secondary school, below the university level),
what could explain such an abrupt increase since 2020 is the Covid pandemic.
Looking back at figure \ref{fig:age_attempted} it becomes easier
to see how people among 13 years old to 18 years old attempted a lot 
more suicides between 2020 and 2022, without dubt they were
the most affected by the pandemic and probably other related reasons..
