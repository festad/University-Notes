logical tool layer,
software applications in order to perform information processing,
we discuss the one connected with enterprise functions,

information processing tools,
each hospital uses a different specific set of sw applications,
we talk about them in a generic way
according to 3gm we discussed the top layer,
then logical tool layer, there is also the physical layer
that describes network infrastructures, there's nothing specific,
except for medical devices, digitalized, ex devices that allows imaging.

Application portfolio -> diagram that describes the software,
organized in three families of application components
 - cis (clinical summary, worklist, app used directly by doctors and nurses),
       order entry, decision planning, result entry),
   clinical information system

 - pas = patient administration system, more for administration of the patient,
   medical report management, storing retrieval, patient record,
   in patient management,

 - departmental, set of applications that support specializations of supply management,
     disposal management, human resource, specializations of execution diagnostic, therapeutic
     procedures, supporting activities to perform an order asking for drugs, lab analysis on blood
     of the patient,...


- patient care
- administration and resource management

active decision support (for the doctor or administration of the hospital, for the managers),

we have these 3 groups, the fundation PAS (attached to the central round core),
are strictly working on the electronic patient record,
this central core is the centre of clinical data concerning the patient,

 
---  set of application components  ---

-------------
PAS
-------------

administration of the patient, contacts of the patient concerning relatives,
it's used for covering patient admission 
the patient ad sys can support allocational resources, allocate bed, room for the patient or
specifical devices, 
must provide complete administrative data of the patient, not the medical patient data,
a purpose is to distribute data to the other components of the hospital,
by means of computer network,
pas has to collect basic administrative informations about the patient,
also other app component can transmit relevant informations about the patient like diagnosis,
why? eg the  doctor can enter in the documentation app component the fact that the patient
was submitted to this diagnosis, it's useful to record information in the patient record and
for billing purpose,
pas is the memory of administrative informations, 

chart - relationships of the patient, Management System (PMS),
PMS = PAS,
from the top there is the HIS, divides into
 - information system for patient care
    support direct activities for patient care
 - managerial information system
    information about quality, financial issues, performances,
    costs supported in the last years, sintetic historical informations
    for tactical decisions,

  . clinical information system

  . patient management system
    client resource management, charging, billing,
    encharged to support the admission of the patient to the hospital,
    patient registration, visit registration, a patient can go to
    the same hospital one or more times,
    used to register the patient and each visit
    scheduling and resource allocation,
    supporting part of scheduling and resource allocation,
    the one interesting the patient, not doctor or medical department,
    focusing only on patients,
    associating an appointment to the patient,
    other resource allocations are bed, medical device

    patient tracking, where the patient is at every moment,
    where does it have to move,

    charging, billing of the patient
    

  . systems for clinical support servicies



electronic medical record -

 - clinical information of the patient
 - administrative information of the patient

patient information system includes patient medical record and contains more,

Patient management system functions:
 - registering patient, clinical admission, transfer to other clinics,
 - it can be monolitic software application or set of applications,
 - client registrations, updates the patient master index for the current visit,
   if the patient 

 - after checking patient data a new visit is created

 second group of services:
 - client resource managemnet,
   typical resources assigned
   tracking of patient,
   appointment and scheduling,
   allocating other types of resources,
   patient tracking,
   billing at charge of the patient,
   application to manage recipes


details of some of these modules

CLIENT REGISTRATION APPLICATION
records that a new person is a patient of the hospital now,
if the patient is new the app allows to record demographic data of the patient,
this application creates and mantains singular record, a numerical record is created,
mantains master list of the patient (record of all past patients of the hospital),
each patient is associated with PIN = patient identification number,
workflow chart,
screenshot of patient administration software application,
planned vs emergency admission,
new visit of the patient,
p.a.s.s. registers the visit, defined clearly as the period between arrival and discharge from hospital,
in patient visit = admission, 
it's not true that each visit is a new case,
because the patient after discharge can come back for a follow up,
when the patient comes back to the hospital it's not created a new case 
but the data are associated with the previous case,

functions:
 confirmation of identity,
 registering instance of service (visit)
 .
 .
then the patient is directed to the ward,
follow up is when the patient has already stayed in the hospital,
it doesn't create a new case,
repeated case -> repeated terapy is programmed, come back after 6 months
to check the evolution of the patient, all visits are parts of the same case,
whereas normaly a visit is a case,


another typical function:
client resource managemet system
resources can be immaterial like time slot of appointment
or concrete like associating patient with service,
assign to specific doctor that started treating the patient,
associating to number 12 room bed number b,
or the patient is associated to medical devices like imaging machines,
treadmils are devices where the patient runs on the device and the 
cardiac effort is measured, physical activities,

the client resource manag sys is organized in 3 functions:
 - appointments and scheduling,
   scans in the calendar to choose available periods,
 - resource allocation, creation of work lists,
   check when and where the resources will be available

 - patient tracking

the appointment is not computer based,
each department has an appointment book (list of appointments),
specific for department of radiology, is organized in booklets,
for specific services provided by this unit,
the radiology unit has a set of booklets for one of the x ray imaging,
magnetic resonance, ... separate list of appointments for any machine,
for any specific modality (x ray is one modality, magnetic resonance is another modality,
computer tomography is another...),
inside a specific modality you find the list of specific appointments,
list of appointments for a specific x ray machine,
into these list of appointments we have to look for empty slots where to assign patient,

                     set of appointments  |
                               |    set of appintments
                               |
                            set of appintments


resource allocation for patient:

tracking the patient, confirming the patient really arrived the ward,
assigning the medical team to the patient,
present patient list,
make query -> location, room, bed number, team associated with each patient,
responsible doctor,

concerning the assignment, example of screenshot of bed reservation, pg 151,
a code describes room and bed,
name of the patient occuping the bed and forcast of period allocation,

a specific subfunction of patient resource allocation subsystem is 
PATIENT TRACKING, enables either the patient or the hospital personal to be aware
of the status of administrative processes and patient location,
now the patient is in this place of the hospital,
patients receive the list of steps they have to follow,
es first blood sample, then talk to anestheologist, then magnetic resonance,..
tracking tells which steps were taken and which not,
automatic capture in time,
when the meeting is completed and when the patient is discharged..

can be implemented in two metaphores:
 - white board
   service of endoscopy, if i'm waiting at emergency service of hospital,
   waiting list, name available only to the personal,
   you can have a number of appointment, status of the patient,
   you can see if the appointment is cancelled, if the patient arrived, 
   if already closed the visit, number of queue, the status of the medical procedure,
   status describing that the patient has already completed the medical procedure OGDS,
   others are in progress and others are waiting,
tracks the patient with respect to specific medical department supposed to treat the patient,
focusing on medical service, 

 - search mechanism,
   concerns a single patient and lists everything he has done or will have to do,
   set of tasks for a patient

PAS is covering the scheduling and resources allocation to patients, covers patient admission, administrative
admission, appointment scheduling, administrative discharge and billing,
it has responsibility to keep data of the patient, administrative data,
this application system should communicate updates to other independent applications that deal with patient data,
it's the master application for patient data

after admitting the patient, he goes to a ward, where it is performed decision making, planning,
planning diagnostic and medical steps, and formalize decisions into order, that can be executed
as diagnostic steps or nursing steps, some coding of orders is performed (of diagnoses),
the medical documentation system supports recording of set of activities,
supports documentation of the medical tasks, may contains specialized modules for medical fields,
clinical documentation -> coding diagnoses, 
medical documentation system supports the staff, general medical knowledge, general classification system,
if the system is smart it can select knowledge preselected forms to speed up,
eg the systems already knows the patient has these problems and can suggest different pahts,
medical documentation system has to support medical workflow,

simple sample is a system like microsoft word,
allows to write documents,
a word processor,
from the medical record the system can suggest templates, to speed up,

nursing management and documentation systems,
recording execution of nursing tasks,
should be able to record formation useful to start nursing acrivities,
history of the patient, current status, targets performing nursing acrivities,
target from 28% to 40%,
second set of cunctionalities:
scheduling and planning activities,
recording conditions, targets, history of patient, keeping track of plan,
nursing terminologies and nursing classification (similar to ict11), encoding standard.

general procedures -> list of the tasks

another software application manages outpatient,

physician orfer entry system -> POE,
permits to record the orders, whereas the previous would record the treatments,
after the decision the doctor transforms decisions in orders,
POE, entering the order has consequences like:
the order is automatically recordered in the medical documetnation system in case they are integrated,
another ocnsequence is this order should be transmitted to who is in charge for this order (es pharmacy if
the order is about drug),
the third consequence is if the system is smart it can notify that something is dangerous in declaring
one order, es 3 hours ago something else was ordered for this patient, duplicate order,

order means order diagnostic, or drugs,
tasks:
 - defining the order (associated with service coming from a service catalog maintained by the hospital),
while formulating the order suggestions are possible,
 - appointment scheduling, moving patient to perform magnetic resonance,
an appointment is needed, empty slot for mag res service,
 - printing of the labels, for blood sample, specimen,
 - communication of the order to the service unit,
 - result reporting (blood),
 - poe is able to assign charges, billing system,

CPOE definition:
portion of clinical information systems, we moved to the cis,
we are analysing modules of clinical information system, we are talking about patient care enterprise functions,
important function can be implemented: real time clinical decision support, dosage, suggestion about dosage, alternative medications,
communication to a doctor "don't use this drug, there is a cheaper one available",
alternative medication suggestion, allergy, duplicate, therapy warning,
different doctors can order same thing within hours -> possible duplicate,


advantages of smart cpoe, 
tallman lettering,
standardized therapy
decision support,
aggregation ordering,
medical history,
systematic recording of activities on patient,
frequency of order - one shot, should be repeated every our,
set frequency,
helps doctors, the cannot forget to repeat the order,
decision support example screenshot

in the meanwhile: when the doctor defines an order,
this order is selected and each service is selected by clinical support system,
because its orders are implemented by this support department, it's important that the cpoe
can send the order to the right service automatically,
comunication between cpoe and other service applications in CIS is important,
our order entry system communicates with departmental software applications (such as farmacy,
laboratory information system, operating theater management, transportation service information system),
unfortunately these inf sys are provided by different providers, 
missing comunication has strong impact on the efficiency of activities performed at the hospital,

chest pain -> system offering set of standard solutions, for example the system suggests drugs for syntomphs,
can suggest laboratory investigations to be performed on the patient, suggestion of nursing activity,
standard suggestions,

list of services -> 
order catalogues, standard list of orders, 
clarity of communication,
standardized order, easier to implement decision support,
set of benefits...
if the orders are based on standard qualities, easier control and audit,
information concerning performing an order,
set of tasks, several service departments,
documented, cpoe, recording the order, results performing the order,
if this comunication is automated every medical step is recorded in a clear way by the
medical documentation system and electronic patient record.

CPOE Order task result sequence graph - NOT to be learned,

orders are entered, the orders are arriving to the service department later on,
decomposed in two tasks (the orders), the radiology department has an automatically created list of tasks to be
done by tomorrow,
list supports automated capture of results...

creation of worklists
 - clinical workstations
 - pharmacy workstations
 - laboratory workstations
 - analyser system interface
 ...

Communication between patient order entry POE and laboratory  information system (LIS)
it's used for clinical analysis but also wine, food, polluted elements...

pag 175, 
scenario where CPOE and LIS are not integrated, are developed independently and
nobody integrated them,
what happens? 
doctors enter order to perform blood analysis, put in container,
and they enter order in CPOE to analyse glucose, potassium,
this order is typed in CPOE, should be printed on some printer,
the requests is entered and later on printed in the clinical area,
some adesive labels are put on the container,
they print paper requests, the labelled sample are sent to the laboratory,
later on the laboratory application is typing from scratch in the system,
the terminal on which is running the LIS,
this typing can introduce errors,
other errors can occure moving the sample, the paper can be lost,
and there is another possible source of problems: after typing the information
concerning the sample, the level on the label is not compatible with
label of the information system, because standards are different,
speciment is relabeled, a new label is printed and putted onto the previous one,
cpoe and lis have different identification systems for the samples,
and finally he sample can be processed by the laboratory,
and then sent back to the clinic (this also is an error prone step),
there are many error prone steps because the systems cpoe and LIS are not integrated
(es chosing a new label),

beetter scenario: CPOE and LIS are integrated,
most error prone steps are removed from the scenario,
enter test order in cpoe, the cpoe sends digitally the request to LIS (over network),
lis receives order of analysing potassium and glucose,
the system once it receives requests uses computer network to send digital image
of the label, directly in the clinical area,
LIS prints the final label to put on the sample, no relabeling,
the sticker is already suitable,
identificator is generated,
the specimen is labeled with LIS label,
there are no dozens of samples anymore, only one on which the label is put directly,
the speciment can be sent to the laboratory with the right lable already,
and they already see the requests from their terminal,
inefficient error prone steps are avoided.
