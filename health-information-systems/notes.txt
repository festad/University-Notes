logical tool layer,
software applications in order to perform information processing,
we discuss the one connected with enterprise functions,

information processing tools,
each hospital uses a different specific set of sw applications,
we talk about them in a generic way
according to 3gm we discussed the top layer,
then logical tool layer, there is also the physical layer
that describes network infrastructures, there's nothing specific,
except for medical devices, digitalized, ex devices that allows imaging.

Application portfolio -> diagram that describes the software,
organized in three families of application components
 - cis (clinical summary, worklist, app used directly by doctors and nurses),
       order entry, decision planning, result entry),
   clinical information system

 - pas = patient administration system, more for administration of the patient,
   medical report management, storing retrieval, patient record,
   in patient management,

 - departmental, set of applications that support specializations of supply management,
     disposal management, human resource, specializations of execution diagnostic, therapeutic
     procedures, supporting activities to perform an order asking for drugs, lab analysis on blood
     of the patient,...


- patient care
- administration and resource management

active decision support (for the doctor or administration of the hospital, for the managers),

we have these 3 groups, the fundation PAS (attached to the central round core),
are strictly working on the electronic patient record,
this central core is the centre of clinical data concerning the patient,

 
---  set of application components  ---

-------------
PAS
-------------

administration of the patient, contacts of the patient concerning relatives,
it's used for covering patient admission 
the patient ad sys can support allocational resources, allocate bed, room for the patient or
specifical devices, 
must provide complete administrative data of the patient, not the medical patient data,
a purpose is to distribute data to the other components of the hospital,
by means of computer network,
pas has to collect basic administrative informations about the patient,
also other app component can transmit relevant informations about the patient like diagnosis,
why? eg the  doctor can enter in the documentation app component the fact that the patient
was submitted to this diagnosis, it's useful to record information in the patient record and
for billing purpose,
pas is the memory of administrative informations, 

chart - relationships of the patient, Management System (PMS),
PMS = PAS,
from the top there is the HIS, divides into
 - information system for patient care
    support direct activities for patient care
 - managerial information system
    information about quality, financial issues, performances,
    costs supported in the last years, sintetic historical informations
    for tactical decisions,

  . clinical information system

  . patient management system
    client resource management, charging, billing,
    encharged to support the admission of the patient to the hospital,
    patient registration, visit registration, a patient can go to
    the same hospital one or more times,
    used to register the patient and each visit
    scheduling and resource allocation,
    supporting part of scheduling and resource allocation,
    the one interesting the patient, not doctor or medical department,
    focusing only on patients,
    associating an appointment to the patient,
    other resource allocations are bed, medical device

    patient tracking, where the patient is at every moment,
    where does it have to move,

    charging, billing of the patient
    

  . systems for clinical support servicies



electronic medical record -

 - clinical information of the patient
 - administrative information of the patient

patient information system includes patient medical record and contains more,

Patient management system functions:
 - registering patient, clinical admission, transfer to other clinics,
 - it can be monolitic software application or set of applications,
 - client registrations, updates the patient master index for the current visit,
   if the patient 

 - after checking patient data a new visit is created

 second group of services:
 - client resource managemnet,
   typical resources assigned
   tracking of patient,
   appointment and scheduling,
   allocating other types of resources,
   patient tracking,
   billing at charge of the patient,
   application to manage recipes


details of some of these modules

CLIENT REGISTRATION APPLICATION
records that a new person is a patient of the hospital now,
if the patient is new the app allows to record demographic data of the patient,
this application creates and mantains singular record, a numerical record is created,
mantains master list of the patient (record of all past patients of the hospital),
each patient is associated with PIN = patient identification number,
workflow chart,
screenshot of patient administration software application,
planned vs emergency admission,
new visit of the patient,
p.a.s.s. registers the visit, defined clearly as the period between arrival and discharge from hospital,
in patient visit = admission, 
it's not true that each visit is a new case,
because the patient after discharge can come back for a follow up,
when the patient comes back to the hospital it's not created a new case 
but the data are associated with the previous case,

functions:
 confirmation of identity,
 registering instance of service (visit)
 .
 .
then the patient is directed to the ward,
follow up is when the patient has already stayed in the hospital,
it doesn't create a new case,
repeated case -> repeated terapy is programmed, come back after 6 months
to check the evolution of the patient, all visits are parts of the same case,
whereas normaly a visit is a case,


another typical function:
client resource managemet system
resources can be immaterial like time slot of appointment
or concrete like associating patient with service,
assign to specific doctor that started treating the patient,
associating to number 12 room bed number b,
or the patient is associated to medical devices like imaging machines,
treadmils are devices where the patient runs on the device and the 
cardiac effort is measured, physical activities,

the client resource manag sys is organized in 3 functions:
 - appointments and scheduling,
   scans in the calendar to choose available periods,
 - resource allocation, creation of work lists,
   check when and where the resources will be available

 - patient tracking

the appointment is not computer based,
each department has an appointment book (list of appointments),
specific for department of radiology, is organized in booklets,
for specific services provided by this unit,
the radiology unit has a set of booklets for one of the x ray imaging,
magnetic resonance, ... separate list of appointments for any machine,
for any specific modality (x ray is one modality, magnetic resonance is another modality,
computer tomography is another...),
inside a specific modality you find the list of specific appointments,
list of appointments for a specific x ray machine,
into these list of appointments we have to look for empty slots where to assign patient,


 ---------------------------------------------------
             diagnostic by imaging
-----------------------------------------------------
                 |
                 |
                  --- xray, magn res, comp tom
                       |       |          |
                       |       |          |
                     set of appointments  |
                               |    set of appintments
                               |
                            set of appintments


resource allocation for patient:

tracking the patient, confirming the patient really arrived the ward,
assigning the medical team to the patient,
present patient list,
make query -> location, room, bed number, team associated with each patient,
responsible doctor,

concerning the assignment, example of screenshot of bed reservation, pg 151,
a code describes room and bed,
name of the patient occuping the bed and forcast of period allocation,

a specific subfunction of patient resource allocation subsystem is 
PATIENT TRACKING, enables either the patient or the hospital personal to be aware
of the status of administrative processes and patient location,
now the patient is in this place of the hospital,
patients receive the list of steps they have to follow,
es first blood sample, then talk to anestheologist, then magnetic resonance,..
tracking tells which steps were taken and which not,
automatic capture in time,
when the meeting is completed and when the patient is discharged..

can be implemented in two metaphores:
 - white board
   service of endoscopy, if i'm waiting at emergency service of hospital,
   waiting list, name available only to the personal,
   you can have a number of appointment, status of the patient,
   you can see if the appointment is cancelled, if the patient arrived, 
   if already closed the visit, number of queue, the status of the medical procedure,
   status describing that the patient has already completed the medical procedure OGDS,
   others are in progress and others are waiting,
tracks the patient with respect to specific medical department supposed to treat the patient,
focusing on medical service, 

 - search mechanism,
   concerns a single patient and lists everything he has done or will have to do,
   set of tasks for a patient

PAS is covering the scheduling and resources allocation to patients, covers patient admission, administrative
admission, appointment scheduling, administrative discharge and billing,
it has responsibility to keep data of the patient, administrative data,
this application system should communicate updates to other independent applications that deal with patient data,
it's the master application for patient data

after admitting the patient, he goes to a ward, where it is performed decision making, planning,
planning diagnostic and medical steps, and formalize decisions into order, that can be executed
as diagnostic steps or nursing steps, some coding of orders is performed (of diagnoses),
the medical documentation system supports recording of set of activities,
supports documentation of the medical tasks, may contains specialized modules for medical fields,
clinical documentation -> coding diagnoses, 
medical documentation system supports the staff, general medical knowledge, general classification system,
if the system is smart it can select knowledge preselected forms to speed up,
eg the systems already knows the patient has these problems and can suggest different pahts,
medical documentation system has to support medical workflow,

simple sample is a system like microsoft word,
allows to write documents,
a word processor,
from the medical record the system can suggest templates, to speed up,

nursing management and documentation systems,
recording execution of nursing tasks,
should be able to record formation useful to start nursing acrivities,
history of the patient, current status, targets performing nursing acrivities,
target from 28% to 40%,
second set of cunctionalities:
scheduling and planning activities,
recording conditions, targets, history of patient, keeping track of plan,
nursing terminologies and nursing classification (similar to ict11), encoding standard.

general procedures -> list of the tasks

another software application manages outpatient,

physician orfer entry system -> POE,
permits to record the orders, whereas the previous would record the treatments,
after the decision the doctor transforms decisions in orders,
POE, entering the order has consequences like:
the order is automatically recordered in the medical documetnation system in case they are integrated,
another ocnsequence is this order should be transmitted to who is in charge for this order (es pharmacy if
the order is about drug),
the third consequence is if the system is smart it can notify that something is dangerous in declaring
one order, es 3 hours ago something else was ordered for this patient, duplicate order,

order means order diagnostic, or drugs,
tasks:
 - defining the order (associated with service coming from a service catalog maintained by the hospital),
while formulating the order suggestions are possible,
 - appointment scheduling, moving patient to perform magnetic resonance,
an appointment is needed, empty slot for mag res service,
 - printing of the labels, for blood sample, specimen,
 - communication of the order to the service unit,
 - result reporting (blood),
 - poe is able to assign charges, billing system,

CPOE definition:
portion of clinical information systems, we moved to the cis,
we are analysing modules of clinical information system, we are talking about patient care enterprise functions,
important function can be implemented: real time clinical decision support, dosage, suggestion about dosage, alternative medications,
communication to a doctor "don't use this drug, there is a cheaper one available",
alternative medication suggestion, allergy, duplicate, therapy warning,
different doctors can order same thing within hours -> possible duplicate,


advantages of smart cpoe, 
tallman lettering,
standardized therapy
decision support,
aggregation ordering,
medical history,
systematic recording of activities on patient,
frequency of order - one shot, should be repeated every our,
set frequency,
helps doctors, the cannot forget to repeat the order,
decision support example screenshot

in the meanwhile: when the doctor defines an order,
this order is selected and each service is selected by clinical support system,
because its orders are implemented by this support department, it's important that the cpoe
can send the order to the right service automatically,
comunication between cpoe and other service applications in CIS is important,
our order entry system communicates with departmental software applications (such as farmacy,
laboratory information system, operating theater management, transportation service information system),
unfortunately these inf sys are provided by different providers, 
missing comunication has strong impact on the efficiency of activities performed at the hospital,

chest pain -> system offering set of standard solutions, for example the system suggests drugs for syntomphs,
can suggest laboratory investigations to be performed on the patient, suggestion of nursing activity,
standard suggestions,

list of services -> 
order catalogues, standard list of orders, 
clarity of communication,
standardized order, easier to implement decision support,
set of benefits...
if the orders are based on standard qualities, easier control and audit,
information concerning performing an order,
set of tasks, several service departments,
documented, cpoe, recording the order, results performing the order,
if this comunication is automated every medical step is recorded in a clear way by the
medical documentation system and electronic patient record.

CPOE Order task result sequence graph - NOT to be learned,

orders are entered, the orders are arriving to the service department later on,
decomposed in two tasks (the orders), the radiology department has an automatically created list of tasks to be
done by tomorrow,
list supports automated capture of results...

creation of worklists
 - clinical workstations
 - pharmacy workstations
 - laboratory workstations
 - analyser system interface
 ...

Communication between patient order entry POE and laboratory  information system (LIS)
it's used for clinical analysis but also wine, food, polluted elements...

pag 175, 
scenario where CPOE and LIS are not integrated, are developed independently and
nobody integrated them,
what happens? 
doctors enter order to perform blood analysis, put in container,
and they enter order in CPOE to analyse glucose, potassium,
this order is typed in CPOE, should be printed on some printer,
the requests is entered and later on printed in the clinical area,
some adesive labels are put on the container,
they print paper requests, the labelled sample are sent to the laboratory,
later on the laboratory application is typing from scratch in the system,
the terminal on which is running the LIS,
this typing can introduce errors,
other errors can occure moving the sample, the paper can be lost,
and there is another possible source of problems: after typing the information
concerning the sample, the level on the label is not compatible with
label of the information system, because standards are different,
speciment is relabeled, a new label is printed and putted onto the previous one,
cpoe and lis have different identification systems for the samples,
and finally he sample can be processed by the laboratory,
and then sent back to the clinic (this also is an error prone step),
there are many error prone steps because the systems cpoe and LIS are not integrated
(es chosing a new label),

beetter scenario: CPOE and LIS are integrated,
most error prone steps are removed from the scenario,
enter test order in cpoe, the cpoe sends digitally the request to LIS (over network),
lis receives order of analysing potassium and glucose,
the system once it receives requests uses computer network to send digital image
of the label, directly in the clinical area,
LIS prints the final label to put on the sample, no relabeling,
the sticker is already suitable,
identificator is generated,
the specimen is labeled with LIS label,
there are no dozens of samples anymore, only one on which the label is put directly,
the speciment can be sent to the laboratory with the right lable already,
and they already see the requests from their terminal,
inefficient error prone steps are avoided.

we were talking about erp, enterprise resource planning,

DATAWARE HOUSE
typically used for hospital mamagement and research
strongly based on the coding of procedures and diagnoses
if it wants to support research,

electronic patient record and electronic health record already discusses,
according to our model we have computer based and non application components,
paper based sheets and forms coded in some rules like precompiled forms
with fields,

describe how to typically treat the cancer,

patient chart,
the patient chart system supports:
 - documentation of body temperature
 - ..

they support order entry, order for nurses,
they replace medical documentation system,

Logical tool layer, integration of application components
 <- interoperability

interoperability is supported by standards..

integration is supported by interoperability,

integration is the union of the parts making a more complex system,
can be meaned as the procedures in order to achieve the property of integration,

Architectures od Hospital Information Systems,
properties fulfilled:
typical patterns and organization of hw and sw components of HIS,
architectures -> taxonomy helping to cathegorize architectures,

if we need to integrate different application components build by
dfferent providers in different epoches, integrating is hard,

an application component is made of or more sw modules,
these modules store data into a database, cpoe, mds (medical documentation system),
store data and write data and read from a database,
criterions to classify:
- how many databases are there?
all the modules might be produced by the same company,
each application has its own database => difficult to make interoperable,
- another criterion to classify is the number of application components,
2 or 10?
- where did you by from? one vendor or more vendors?
- patterns and schema of communication links,
peer to peer, hybrid, centralized...
- types of integration that can be achieved

Number of databases:
one single database vs each application each database,
applications need database to store relevant information
that we don't want to lose in persistent way, about entity types,
applications that support hospital functions need to store
in a persistent way infos about entity types,
demographic infos about the patient, cases, PIN, CIN, insurances,
admitting diagnosis of the patient,

these entity types need to be managed by the ?? that needs to use a database,

db1 style:
central databse, all computer applications store in this database,
only possible when database schema is known by all applications,
all share the same organization of data, typical when all app come
from same producer,
example of db1
LIS and RIS are interoperable,
either they come from same vendor or are developed internally,
if they come from different vendors they are not db1 style,
store data about entity types,

consequence of dbn
data stored in different app components are on different databases,
several databases may overlap the same information,
if you store the same data in different databases you create
redundancy,
consistency of redundant data is a problem solved manually,
asking people to update data is not a good solution,
otherwise, synchronize databases,
hw and sw infrastructure to implement automatic methodes,
automatic propagation:
for each entity type there is a master application,
if birth day is wrong, you can't use the RIS,
the master application is the PAS,
if the radiologist wants to update the data he needs to ask
to patiend administration system,
for each type of information there is a master system
to manage and spread info to other systems,
only if different applicaiton can receive messages,
are interoperable,
not possible when app components aren't connected,
are not interoperable and not connected by network,
the organization of data needs different applications
if there's not ntetwork, and they need to keep integrity by
asking personally to update, there's no automated way.

ex of dbn style,
not good because each app has its own database,
if there's some update of data patient in an application,
to propagate it you need interoperability between the systems,
need for standards, something complex.

single database is easy to manage but hard to find in real world,
because it is difficult to stop from further application component
buying or creating,

Mix of db1 and dbn,
there are some modules from IBM that work on its own database,
then some other components are bought without theirdatabase,

- monolitic application
- modular application
only sw component - ac1, application component 1,
does not support all hospital functions,

acn, n application components,
modular architecture,
separate software modules,

it's possible that modular architecture is db1,
designed to work on same database,
db1 + acn,
when app come from same vendor,
all in one vs best of the breed

high omogenity vs high eterogenity

high level of omogenity -> all in one,

when you select for each module the best on the marked

spaghetti vs star:
 - peer to peer is spaghetti,
 - star, devoted central component to support app components,

data sending in json format, sql commands,

Sante'Ware
Mirth Connect,

Permits interoperability communication between laboratory analysis,
exchange of data with radiology (DICOM),
data from laboratory, administrative data,
labels related to data format,
formats hl7, dicom, ascii,...
software that permits bidirectional communication between
any pair of applications,
one interface able to enable communication between any other,

star architecture, service oriented architecture,
one application component serving as a broker,

General requirements:
base properties that are very good:
 - integrity in the data
 - consistency
 (several copies tell the same story,
 no contradiction,
 several copies of same invoice
 report the same amount)
 - integration

Integration = put together,
but there are
- data integration
- contestual integration
- sw integration
- hw
- semantic integration

supported by different standards,

consistency integration and referencial integrity
(integrity = the data stored in the databases
are correct, depicting the reality in correct way,
eg description in correct way of the patient),

referential integrity is that
when you have pieces of information describing
different aspects of the same patient these
different parts are kept linked,
in any moment they can be put together,
a patient that went to an hospital twice,
there are two cases, referential integrity is that
we know that the two cases are concerning the same patient,
we don't have when it appears that the two cases are not related,
in this case the patient identification number
helps in keeping referential integrity,
pre condition: object identity,
patient identification number,
identify data in a correct way,
all pieces of data linkable to the same patient.

without object identity there's no referential integrity
concepts not specific for digital systems,
they're valid also on paper based information,

patient administration system and RIS are not agreeing
about data on the patient there is no referential
integrity

consistency: important condition for integrity,
no consistency => no integrity,
no way to say which is the correct data about the patient,
if data is no identical, data is inconsistent,
a way to keep consistency about data stored
in different databases is to use transaction management systems,

first name of the patient entered and medical documentation system has it available,
data integration through server,
radiologist has not to retype if there's data integration,
data ubiquity = data available everywhere in the hospital,


semantic integration,
can be supported my medical data dictionary,
standard dictionaries of medical diagnoses, dictionaries,
can be supported by adopting the same medical data of
catalogs dictionary medical terms

Medical documentation system can be digitally sent on the same
network and understood automatically,
statistics can be made because all hospitals use
the same coding system

I want to type an order for drug for Mario Rossi and John Smith,

then I want to register this ordering
in the patient record,
the other application already shows the record without performing
a second search

The last type of integration is process integration


-> | read the card  | -> adpointment -> read document for       -> transmit patient
   | of the patient |                    general practictioner      data ward

3 different application components,
there is process integration if these components interact between them
in order to support the person that is using this,
switching from app 1 to app 2 i don't need to retype the patient id,
moving from an app to another the patient number 222 is already selected,
all info from app1 are already available to app2 and app3,
when this applications are interoperable,
presentation integration, data integration, semantic integration
all support process integration, which is higher level

Consistent referencial integrity in multiple application components:
STANDARDS


-----------
STANDARDS
-----------

RIS and Provider Of Entry System,
can use HL7 as a standard to communicate
between each other,
RIS and CPOE may come from the same provider
so they might already have a shared database,

application components have to be integrated
to communicate,
when they communicate we can integrate them,
a consensus must exist about syntax and semantic,
textual data, DICOM to exchange radiological images
and data related to radiological imaging,
ISO/IEEE, CCOW for contextual integration,
EDIFACT standard for suppliers of material for the hospital,
order sending and confirmation from provider using EDIFACT,
there are several standards,
storing digital patient record,
structure of medical documents that form the digital patient record,
contribution to data integration,
store patient record,
medical record according to CDA standard,
can be sent trough different applications,
CDA is giving the structure, there are inner
different coding systems,
A standard is a definition or a format approved
by some organization that develop standards,
eg IEEE, the most of the industries and companies
adopt these definitions and formats,
'standard de facto',
larger number of companies have agreed on using them,
not formally approved.
Within healthcare standards exist for different
information processing:
- for data vocabularies,
- data formats
- information representation and exchange,
- collecting data
- for medical documents
- messages
- communication protocols (HL7, DICOM),
- representation of knowledge (processes, decisions)

Standards about IT in healthcare,
for IT infrastructures there are GUIs, OSs,
Access Control Identifiers,
standards for specific application domains,
eg used by doctors,
to describe medical document, disease, medical procedures,

Some standard can be implicit,
the way information is organized in radiological report follows
an implicit standard (title, description, diagnosis, date
in certain position),
this supports sharing of infos between doctors,

Standards support communication
The types of standards in health care are
complex,
example of data standard for describing procedures
of diseases, information content,
data based on which field is descripted
eg standard way of representing doctor, patient,
employee, role,.. a single value (eg address, name of disease),
standards to exchange:
from app a to app b, message standards,
for identifiers, eg for coding,
for assigning unique id to the patient,
for coding hospitals, medical personal, citizens,
invoices, privacy and security standards,
business process standards,
for workflow, dataflow,

Health Domain Standatds,
representation by abstraction level

- data standards
- information standards
- knowledge standards,

data stds small complexity
info stds more complex level


----------------
16 - 11 - 2021
----------------

We were talking about standards,
the erp to enter the orders (for linens, medical devices),
order typed into the erp, and it can be sent by means of
the communication network provided by the ERP,
erp sends orders and receives confirmations, invoices..

There are several cathegories of standards,
 - data standards (vocabularies),
   support definitions of very simple items,

 - information content standard
   define how classes are defined and
   the relationships with different
   pieces of information, more complex

 - information exchange standards
   deals with simple or complex pieces of information representing
   a model from information data or content standard,
   find a way to code simple or complex informations
   and how to send them over the network,

higher level standards aggregate informations,
on the right there are the processes using the informations
on the left the small informations

National Biosurveillance Use Case

107 standard,

UMLS unified medical language system,
map a code from icdt to loinc,
supports interoperability between different
organizations using different standards,
to aggregate informations a mapping is needed,
umls is the tool.

It's also a set of libraries.

Standards are sets of documents,
certification is very important,

--------
HL7
--------

High level, concerning technological level,
has to provide a way for migration of
data for patient care,
exchange, management, integration of
data in order to support the enterprise
function 'PATIENT CARE',
it's not covering interoperability, management of the hospital..
just patient administration, admission of patient,
medical decision of patient, order entry, patient discharge,
medical care documentation.

From technological level,
provides standard for exchange of data between
pairs of software application used in health care organization,
reduces the custom interface and program maintenance,
ref to spaghetti architectural style (pg 241),
without standard you need n software interfaces if you want
to make communication between n applications,
exchange of data is used for patient registration,
information sent to medical information system,
to do this you need a sw interface if there's no standard,
if the two softwares have a standard they can already communicate.

Standard reduces custom interface programming between software
application pairs.
Custom interface programming also has to be updated every time,
whereas a standard cancels this work.

HL7 is an important standard,
the systems on the territory of Lombardia (system pharmacies,
hospitals, general practitioners, can exchange informations),

there are 2 main version:
version 2 old
version 3 still old but almost all systems use version 2,

in brescia there are boxes take data from machine and translate into hl7,
the version used is version 2,

data about entity type,
describes events (when they are detected, a system module
sends a message to another),
the event triggers the patient administration system to send
informations to another application system,
hl7 describes events,
eg A01 -> admission of a patient,

for each event there is a specific type of message,
eg events:
A01 -> admission
A02 -> transfer to another organizational unit (patient discharged),
       to inform that the patient
       has moved
A03 -> patient has been completely discharged

hl7 is also a communication protocol, iso osi stack,
interoperable with tcp ip, it works if you install
the HL7 MLLP (minimal lower layer protocol),
hl7 is also interoperable with serial interfaces,
can be used to take serial data coming from medical devices,
these boxes converting serial data to hl7 messages can be sent
over ethernet,
hl7 interactions operate between paires,
it's point to point communication model,
eg
order entry system <-----> laboratory information system
used by doctor  --sends order--> receives the order,
                                 understands it,
				 appears on terminal of people
				 working in that laboratory
	     <---confirmation--
receives confirmation

ASCII character,
no tabs, can be written with text editor,
set of rows, each row is called segment,
a segment is a piece of information contained
in the message,
each segment starts with 3characters code,
eg MSH describes message header,
   EVN is the event type 
   PID patient identification,

there is timestamp, 198808181126
EVN | A01 | timestamp
PID ||| PATID1234 || JONES^WILLIAM^A^III|

typed by the clerk in the terminal,
admitting diagnoses, malign neuclasy, liver, | timestamp

info should not be typed again if it is already in the database

version three is more complex so it has less implementations

HL7 describes events and messages,

when there are 2 app components what happens is that
there's an event (new patient arriving), the event
is recorded from a person in app comp A,
when it is completed, A sends to app comp B of his,
telling that the new event happened, the person arrived
at the hospital,
B sends ACK (acknowledgement),
new event can also mean that a new set of data is ready in the machine

HL7 vers 2 is ASCII based,
in HL7 vers 3 it's XML based,
restriction of XML, only a set of predefined text and data fields
are allowed.

HL7 3 was created in the 90s,
the tags and the structure are
complaiant with data model ->
information classes describe phisical thing of interest,
eg described persons, organization, patient admitted to specific
ward, roles, attributes (features) for patient, employer, phisician,
role of nurse, doctor, employer,

The way to describe person, doctor, patient.. are standardized by the
reference information model,
also the way to describe that a doctor
is author of medical acts is standardized,
a medical act can be encounter, observation, procedures, medications,
orders are examples of acts,
the model describes in a standard way observations, encounters,
surgery operations,
there's a way to describe that a surgery was performed by a specified team.

reference information model is the standard.

This flexibility is obtained by having an attribute in acts,

Version 3 messages is complaint with the model,
some xml text has tag 'observation event',
structures of classes is used to define the structure of messages

Messages are very long, pair tag-content_tag

---------
DICOM
---------
deals with digital images,
it's a standard used in medical
imaging,
in RIS, and PACS, expecially PACS,
stores digital images, prints,..

Generic DICOM Model

first 4 documents
first document is an overview,
part 2 describes what it is to be conformed with DICOM,

DICOM data object is an abstraction of real world entity,
like image, report, related to radiology workflow,
grouped into data sets,
Dicom uses already existing standards like jpeg,
to describe the textual metadata of images,
textual description of the study, description,
jpeg used to describe the image,
other standards describe the study (snowmed),

the part four describes service classes,
basic work list management service class
print management service class (to print image
in either dvd or piece of paper or transparent film,
to add it to a report paper based)

Application entity: software layer between
communication layer and medical information application,
application entity has a definition of services required
from medical information (retrieving image service, print service),
there's definition of information object,
there's how to encode and store definition of
objects in terms of standards,
how to exchange data related to an image over the network
and how to store in a database the image,
in DICOM you can store to file system or into database,
2 interfaces:
 to send over network
 to save

Provides access to storage media,

services and objects:
service to store image file and sending it to pacs workstation where
radiologist can watch the image and write a report,
to keep consistence,
the doctor can see always the same image thanks to consistency,
standard tries to make homogeneous the representaion,

querying service,
to retrieve a specific image made this day, or a specific service,
modality worklist pulls information,
eg by means of the RIS the doctor already put data,
with the modality worklist the list will appear also on the pacs,
before data are entered in ris and data are sent from ris to
pacs, no need to type twice,
pacs activates machine and retrieves data from machines,
offline media -> service implemented in the branch
of storing into file system,
 (the two interfaces are storing in filesystem vs sending over network),
pacs has a local storage for temporary images,
there is an usage scenario
