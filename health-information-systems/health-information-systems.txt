RIS-PACS-CIS
-------------
finishing patient data management system
scoring systems: system permitted to assigne
scores, classification of diseases,
assigns a patient to a class,
pdms keeps the scores assigned to the patient,
specific for an organ or for a disease,
es level of coma,

TISS

software module supporting operation activities,
surgeons,..
it's called operation management system,
supports planning and documentation of surgery operations,
it's a specialization of the enterprise function
'execution of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures',
it schedules the operations, assigns the time and the date
to an operation, 
assigns operation resources like the room, (operating room),
sets an appointment for the surgery,
assigns human resources (surgeons, anesthesiologist, staff),
medical team,
supports the collection of data that will occure during the surgery operation,
it's connected to the medical documentation system and the cpoe (to enter
the order) because when you enter the order for the surgery you
need to specify date, time, team...
these information are also recorder in the medical record of the patient
(the medical documentation system adds those informations to the medical record),
the oms also supports during the surgery,
eg it documents informations like the difference between planned
team and actual team,

RIS and PACS
sometimes seen as a single module, they're well integrated,
sw and hw components that permit to performe diagnosis
by imaging, Radiology Information System 
(radiology is the first type of diagnosis by imaging),
and Picture Archiving & Communications System.
The purpose is to facilitate the patient care by enabling
radiographers and radiologists in the work
they have to perform and the report they
have to write.
Typically the patient is moved to the room using some kind of modality,
eg XRay, magnetic resonance, computer tomography,
the patient is taken to a room, a specific modality is used,
some images of the patient organ are taken,
then the images are visualized on a screen,
the radiologist analyzes the images, and general informations
like health care status, she makes a diagnosis of the patient,
later on a report is written about this.
Support of images procedures and report writing on the findings.
The RISPACS is tipically integrated with the
clinical information system, that includes a set of modules used for the
patient care, eg CPOE, this permits clinicians to make orders, requiring a specific
radiology investigation, view resulting images and related reports,
the order goes from the cis/cpoe to the ris pacs and then the pacs sends an image and report back to the CIS,
by means of the cpoe you can send the order,
by means of the medical documentation system
the doctor can analyze the images and reports,
and add them to the medical documentation of the patient,
the patiend record is in a database
the images and reports are analyzed by the doctor
at the ward using the medical documentation system,
and later on the images and reports are stored
into the patient record of the specific patient.
By means of the cpoe the doctor that wants a magnetic resonance to be done on his patient
can open the cpoe application, look for an
available time slot for the magnetic resonance
the reservation is possible because the cpoe
is talking to the ris pacs, the ris is keeping
all the available schedules and free slots
and these slots for a specific modality or technician,
later on the order can be formalized and can
be sent to the ris, so this order is visualized
on the terminal of the radiologist,
the radiologists knows that it is required to perform
a magnetic resonance on Annie's right leg,
after performing the magnetic investigation
the radiologist analyzes the images 
using the pacs system, he sees the images
on the screen, he analyzes also the other health informations
on the patient,
he writes a report that is later on sent back
together with the images to the medical documentation system
the doctor at the ward can see the images,
he can store the images and report in the patient record.
A good RIS-PACS system should enable also clinical
departments to use it to perform imaging procedures
and acquire images for their own use.
The system can be also distributed,
can be used by other clinical departments,
it's not only used by the radiology department.
Sometimes the imaging procedures are concerning
portable devices, you don't move the patient to
the radiology department but you take
the device (typical for echocardiography,
ultrasounds for obstetricians and gynecologists),
they take this machine to the ward,
they perform the investigation,
they get the images and those should be
managed by the ris-pacs system,
so it should be a distributed system,
vailable also on portable devices,
if you move a portable device later on
you need to communicate the images to the
central database of the images.
Ris-pacs are also used by the dentists,

The usual classification is between 
- information system for patient care
 - patient management/administration system
 - clinical information system (includes cpoe,...)
 - systems for clinical support services
  - laboratory information system
  - pharmacy information system
  - radiology informatio system
   - pacs
- managerial information system

the radiology department or diagnosis by imaging department
can be called both ways, they are typical support services,
the radiology informatio system and the pacs provide data to the patient information
database, specifically to the electronic medical record,
the pacs deals with the images generated and collected during the investigation.

Let's see the functions associated with ris and pacs.
For clinicians the ris and pacs as a whole
enables the clinicians to request order for services
(different types of imaging examinations),
view the images taken and view the interpretations (reports)
made by radiologists,
ris and pacs should be integrated with the cpoe,
the cpoe for what concernes the request/order service
and integrated with the medical documentation system for what concerns the view of images and reports.
Radiologist and radiographer are working not at the ward
but at the diagnosing by imaging department,
the system facilitates the work of these people
and also the work of other care providers such as cardiologists, obstetricians, gynecologists
who use portable devices.
What kind of support is offered to radiologists, radiographers?
- Manage and perform the capture of images, storage and distribution,
(sending to meidcal documentation system)
- operate the machines that produce these images, ris not only allows to type that the machine is going
to be used but can also send commands to the machine,
the software is the remote controller of the
command center of the machines,
- permits to interact with the clinicians who requests the images,
sending messages,
- carry out clinical functions since the procedure involves
the patient directly, permits to control the machine to change
the positioning or permits drugs administration,
eg drugs to increase the contrast of the images,
ris controls the machines injecting the drug,

Imaging workflow based on ris, pacs and cis:
