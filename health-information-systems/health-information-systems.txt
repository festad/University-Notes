RIS-PACS-CIS
-------------
finishing patient data management system
scoring systems: system permitted to assigne
scores, classification of diseases,
assigns a patient to a class,
pdms keeps the scores assigned to the patient,
specific for an organ or for a disease,
es level of coma,

TISS

software module supporting operation activities,
surgeons,..
it's called operation management system,
supports planning and documentation of surgery operations,
it's a specialization of the enterprise function
'execution of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures',
it schedules the operations, assigns the time and the date
to an operation, 
assigns operation resources like the room, (operating room),
sets an appointment for the surgery,
assigns human resources (surgeons, anesthesiologist, staff),
medical team,
supports the collection of data that will occure during the surgery operation,
it's connected to the medical documentation system and the cpoe (to enter
the order) because when you enter the order for the surgery you
need to specify date, time, team...
these information are also recorder in the medical record of the patient
(the medical documentation system adds those informations to the medical record),
the oms also supports during the surgery,
eg it documents informations like the difference between planned
team and actual team,

RIS and PACS
sometimes seen as a single module, they're well integrated,
sw and hw components that permit to performe diagnosis
by imaging, Radiology Information System 
(radiology is the first type of diagnosis by imaging),
and Picture Archiving & Communications System.
The purpose is to facilitate the patient care by enabling
radiographers and radiologists in the work
they have to perform and the report they
have to write.
Typically the patient is moved to the room using some kind of modality,
eg XRay, magnetic resonance, computer tomography,
the patient is taken to a room, a specific modality is used,
some images of the patient organ are taken,
then the images are visualized on a screen,
the radiologist analyzes the images, and general informations
like health care status, she makes a diagnosis of the patient,
later on a report is written about this.
Support of images procedures and report writing on the findings.
The RISPACS is tipically integrated with the
clinical information system, that includes a set of modules used for the
patient care, eg CPOE, this permits clinicians to make orders, requiring a specific
radiology investigation, view resulting images and related reports,
the order goes from the cis/cpoe to the ris pacs and then the pacs sends an image and report back to the CIS,
by means of the cpoe you can send the order,
by means of the medical documentation system
the doctor can analyze the images and reports,
and add them to the medical documentation of the patient,
the patiend record is in a database
the images and reports are analyzed by the doctor
at the ward using the medical documentation system,
and later on the images and reports are stored
into the patient record of the specific patient.
By means of the cpoe the doctor that wants a magnetic resonance to be done on his patient
can open the cpoe application, look for an
available time slot for the magnetic resonance
the reservation is possible because the cpoe
is talking to the ris pacs, the ris is keeping
all the available schedules and free slots
and these slots for a specific modality or technician,
later on the order can be formalized and can
be sent to the ris, so this order is visualized
on the terminal of the radiologist,
the radiologists knows that it is required to perform
a magnetic resonance on Annie's right leg,
after performing the magnetic investigation
the radiologist analyzes the images 
using the pacs system, he sees the images
on the screen, he analyzes also the other health informations
on the patient,
he writes a report that is later on sent back
together with the images to the medical documentation system
the doctor at the ward can see the images,
he can store the images and report in the patient record.
A good RIS-PACS system should enable also clinical
departments to use it to perform imaging procedures
and acquire images for their own use.
The system can be also distributed,
can be used by other clinical departments,
it's not only used by the radiology department.
Sometimes the imaging procedures are concerning
portable devices, you don't move the patient to
the radiology department but you take
the device (typical for echocardiography,
ultrasounds for obstetricians and gynecologists),
they take this machine to the ward,
they perform the investigation,
they get the images and those should be
managed by the ris-pacs system,
so it should be a distributed system,
vailable also on portable devices,
if you move a portable device later on
you need to communicate the images to the
central database of the images.
Ris-pacs are also used by the dentists,

The usual classification is between 
- information system for patient care
 - patient management/administration system
 - clinical information system (includes cpoe,...)
 - systems for clinical support services
  - laboratory information system
  - pharmacy information system
  - radiology informatio system
   - pacs
- managerial information system

the radiology department or diagnosis by imaging department
can be called both ways, they are typical support services,
the radiology informatio system and the pacs provide data to the patient information
database, specifically to the electronic medical record,
the pacs deals with the images generated and collected during the investigation.

Let's see the functions associated with ris and pacs.
For clinicians the ris and pacs as a whole
enables the clinicians to request order for services
(different types of imaging examinations),
view the images taken and view the interpretations (reports)
made by radiologists,
ris and pacs should be integrated with the cpoe,
the cpoe for what concernes the request/order service
and integrated with the medical documentation system for what concerns the view of images and reports.
Radiologist and radiographer are working not at the ward
but at the diagnosing by imaging department,
the system facilitates the work of these people
and also the work of other care providers such as cardiologists, obstetricians, gynecologists
who use portable devices.
What kind of support is offered to radiologists, radiographers?
- Manage and perform the capture of images, storage and distribution,
(sending to meidcal documentation system)
- operate the machines that produce these images, ris not only allows to type that the machine is going
to be used but can also send commands to the machine,
the software is the remote controller of the
command center of the machines,
- permits to interact with the clinicians who requests the images,
sending messages,
- carry out clinical functions since the procedure involves
the patient directly, permits to control the machine to change
the positioning or permits drugs administration,
eg drugs to increase the contrast of the images,
ris controls the machines injecting the drug,

Imaging workflow based on ris, pacs and cis:

We have all the involved systems:
- radiology information system
- clinical information system
- machine (xray/magnetic)
- reporting application
- PACS
- viewing application (permits to display images)

By means of the clinical information system
the doctor working at the ward is submittig an order
to perform diagnosis by taking medical images,
eg the order requires magnetic resonance,
the order is changing the schedule of the magnetic
resonance team and machine, 
by adding in the schedule this order.
A task is created, the machine is allocated
for performing the investigation on Annie,
a technician is assigned to this task,
the investigation is performed (images caught),
later on the images associated with some metadata
(data about the patient and appointment),
the clinical information system allows to view
the progress status, the completion status of the task,
once the machine is taken, it is transfered to the picture
archive communication system (pac), it receive the digital
image from the machine, performs some indexing of the image,
the image with metadata is stored, later on it 
can be distributed.
In parallel, after taking the image, 
the doctor analyzing the image is using
a reporting application to request, view
the image, then it analyzes it, write and store 
the report, releases it, so it can be analyzed
by other doctors and then distributed.
The report and images are going to the viewing application,
the viewing application is called inside the clinical
information system,
the doctor asking for the imaging procedure can
read the report and view any of them (images and report),
if the viewing application is integrated with the clinical
information system, the doctor is making all activities
inside the clinical information system,
using the same software application for all tasks 
(perform order, check availability of machines and teams,
view report, request images...),
everything happens inside the same system (so the doctor
hasn't to make many logins to different applications, 
the gui is the same, no copy-paste from one application
to another...)
We are gonna see what are the typical functionalities
of RIS,
keep in mind that RIS and PACS are very interconnected,
sometimes it's hard to say which functionalities are whose,
RIS is more with alphanumerical data, 
PACS is more with images,
but sometimes some functionalities are implemented as part
of the picture archiving and communications system.
A warder can make an order for diagnosis for imaging,
so it implies scheduling an appointment,
the RIS offers features comparable with those of the
outpatient management system, that is:
- registering patients,
- appointment scheduling,
- organization of examinations and staff (workflow management),
- comunicate patient data and examination parameters
to the radiographers and radiologists,
radiologists can change the examination parameters,
- creation of radiology report,
- documentation and coding of activities,
each procedure is coded, performing a magnetic
resonance to upper part of the leg has a different
code than for lower part,
- ris can also collect data to produce and visualize
statistics,
usage statistics of a personal, of machines,
to get the actual amount of usage is important
to know if the usage is ok or not.

Let's see the interconnection with RIS and modalities
(tecnology used for imaging),
different tecnologies:
- digital tecnologies
- analog tecnologies

The old style is analog tecnology,
produces a film like old style camera,
the impression on the film is made by xrays
crossing the body of the patient,
the image is created directly from the application,
the image is not transformed into bits and then processed by algoritms,

computer tomography, magnetic resonance are digital imaging,
during the procedure there are sensors, collecting infos about
the patient, there are sensors reading magnetic fields,
later on this information is digitalized and algorithms
process these info to create a 3d image,

RIS offers features similar to outpatient management system, 
the special feature of RIS is the close connection to the modalities,
the RIS is interconnected with modalities,
the RIS is the sw app used to manage a working list
for each modality,
a set of infos like name of the patient, date and time,
machine assigned to this examination,
the RIS is mantaining the working list for each modality
and gets back confirmation on the completion of the radiological
investigation.
The software can be produced by the same producers
of the modalities.
Other features of RIS are:
- order entry (the ris is supposed to be connected
to cpoe, orders made in the cpoe need to be converted
into orders for RIS,
this interconnection occurs through exchange of hl-7 (standard) messages,
- access to clinical information
radiographers can access to clinical informations:
eg presence of allergies, pregnancy, they can access directly from RIS,
Ris sends a request to CIS and CIS answers to RIS.
if the radiographer should give to the patient some drug to the patient
in order to perform the imaging procedure, the radiographer will write 
this info to the RIS, if RIS is well integrated with CIS, will send this info
to the CIS and this event will be stored in the patient record,
so the info won't be missed.
- decision support: conflicting and redundant orders,
the system can have a mechanism to detect repeated orders,
the RIS can send a warning of redundancy about the same investigation
from two doctors.
If RIS and CPOE are well integrated, RIS can send the warning
about redundancy directly to CPOE, so the doctor making the order
immediately receives this information.

Let's talk about PACS:
- creation of work lists (can be performed by RIS as well)
definitive assignment of cases to workers or resources,
- image capture:
the pacs system (a server with sw application and terminals)
are communicating with the machine, receive digital data from
the machine, machine -> sw application -> database,
the images are stored in central memory, then compressed and
transfered to database,
- image storage on the database,
assigning metadata,
- image distribution (eg from db to clinical information system),
- image retrieval (if img was stored for long term),
- decompressing image: we are dealing with heavy images,
typically PACS perform a lot of optimizations,
they use fast and slow databases (for very soon retrievable
images or long term storage),
- tracking of status of imaging process
