Go kart track


I need to build a web information system for an exam.
My idea is to build an information system dealing with go karting tracks.
The end users can be:
- administrator of a go karting track
- registered user (pilot) who can see all the races he partecipated in
- public user (not registered), who can see the different tracks and the leaderboard (the best times for each track, the rankings by male, female, weight, type of go kart...
- organizer who can propose to an administrator an event inviting different pilots 

What you can do in a go karting track is a race, a race can be with fixed time (at most n minutes, the winner is the one that does the best time lap) or with fixed laps (the winner is the one who finished the laps first). A typical event is constituted by a qualification (fixed minutes) and a final (fixed laps), the administrator can schedule the day so that he can publish on the public calendar when the track is busy or when it is free, and the user (pilot or even not registered) can check when it is free so he can ask to book the track).
The organizer usually can invite pilots to events that can be a simple qualification+final or it can be e.g. 3 qualifications and 3 finals, depending on the number of partecipants and he can ask the administrator to book the track by choosing which of the available formulas (for example a go karting track can offer only certain types of qualification+final (e.g. either 7 min qualification  + 7 laps final or 9 min qualification + 9 laps final...) and to approximate how much the final will take we can use the average lap time of all users on that track and multiply by the number of laps.
The track has different attributes like the length, the material of the track (I don't know, asfalto or resina or cemento...), the types of go kart supported (I don't know, sodi, ...), whether it is outdoor, indoor or both (it can change during the year)...

Can you start making up an entity relationship model? Later I will need to translate it into a logical model (database model).

Certainly! An Entity-Relationship (ER) model is essential for understanding the relationships and cardinalities between different entities within a system. I'll describe an ER model for your go-karting system.

Entities and Attributes:

Track:

TrackID (Primary Key)
Name
Length
Material
LocationType (Indoor, Outdoor, Both)
SupportedKartTypes
AverageLapTime
Administrator:

AdminID (Primary Key)
Name
Email
Password
TrackID (Foreign Key)
RegisteredUser (Pilot):

UserID (Primary Key)
Name
Email
Password
Gender
Weight
KartType
Race:

RaceID (Primary Key)
TrackID (Foreign Key)
Type (Time-limited or Lap-limited)
Duration (either time in minutes or number of laps)
WinnerUserID (Foreign Key)
Event:

EventID (Primary Key)
OrganizerID (Foreign Key)
Date
TrackID (Foreign Key)
Type (e.g., Qualification, Final)
RaceID (Foreign Key)
Organizer:

OrganizerID (Primary Key)
Name
Email
Password
Leaderboard:

LeaderboardID (Primary Key)
TrackID (Foreign Key)
UserID (Foreign Key)
BestTime
Booking:

BookingID (Primary Key)
TrackID (Foreign Key)
UserID/OrganizerID (Foreign Key)
Date
StartTime
EndTime
Status (Booked, Free)
Relationships:

An Administrator manages one Track, but one Track can be managed by many Administrators (1:N).
An Organizer can propose many Events, but each Event is proposed by only one Organizer (1:N).
A RegisteredUser (Pilot) can participate in many Races, but each Race can have multiple Pilots (M:N). This relationship can have an attribute "Position" to store the pilot's position in a race.
An Event consists of multiple Races but each Race is part of only one Event (1:N).
A Track can have multiple Bookings, but each Booking refers to only one Track (1:N).
A RegisteredUser (Pilot) or Organizer can make many Bookings, but each Booking is made by only one user or organizer (1:N).
A Track has one Leaderboard, but the Leaderboard corresponds to only one Track (1:1).
This is a high-level ER model for the system you described. Depending on the system's complexity and specific requirements, you may need to refine this model further. Once you're satisfied with the ER model, you can proceed to translate it into a logical database model with tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, etc.

I think that each race at the end needs to contain a measure for every lap for every user so that every pilot can see what he did at every lap of the race, these data are also used for the leaderboard (maybe I should have called it the ranking) that has to consider every pilot's best time-lap (whether it comes from a time-limited or lap-limited race, e.g. if someone does the best time-lap ever of the last month, or the last year, or ever, then the ranking will have to be updated). Maybe a database entity for the ranking doesn't even need to be created but it can be calculated everytime or maybe it is better to create it, you decide. The leaderboard should show at first sight the best n (e.g. 10) performances in the last week, in the last month and ever for both male and female pilots. Another thing, since a race should contain the results but when an organizer organizes the event he cannot know the result of every race yet, should different classes be used or the same entity can be used and initialized with null parameters for the results (the list of every lap-time for every pilot and the ranking based on whether it was a final ( lap-limited, order of arrival) or a qualification (time-liimted, order of best time-lap)).

Considering the additional requirements, we'll need to make a few modifications to the ER model:

LapRecord:
LapRecordID (Primary Key)
RaceID (Foreign Key)
UserID (Foreign Key)
LapNumber
LapTime
This entity would represent the time for each lap by each user in a given race. Each lap by each pilot in every race will have a unique record.

For the Race entity:
Result (it can be a derived attribute or a composite attribute depending on how you want to structure the data, e.g., an ordered list of UserID based on the final results)
For the leaderboard (or ranking as you referred to), a separate entity might not be required if it's purely based on the best lap times. It can be a derived data calculated based on the LapRecord entity every time. However, if we want to reduce the computational overhead, especially when dealing with large volumes of data, we can consider storing the top 'n' results in a separate entity.

Ranking (optional for optimized performance):
RankingID (Primary Key)
UserID (Foreign Key)
TrackID (Foreign Key)
BestLapTime
DateAchieved
Gender
If we opt for the above approach, an update mechanism should be triggered whenever a new lap record is made that beats the previous top 'n' lap times. This would keep the Ranking entity updated.

Regarding the Event and Race issue: an event can be initialized with basic information, and the race records can be filled in later after the event takes place. This allows for the flexibility to have race entities without results initially and to update them as results come in. The same can be said for the race; it can be initialized without results, and results can be updated in the LapRecord entity as the race takes place.

So, when an organizer creates an event, they would also create the associated races but with no results (null results). After the race is complete, the LapRecord entity is updated with the lap times for each user, and subsequently, the Race entity's Result attribute can be derived or updated based on the LapRecord data.

In database design, using null values can be acceptable for attributes that will be populated later, especially when the lack of initial data is inherent to the process, as it is in this scenario. However, always ensure that the application logic can handle null values correctly, especially when reading from or writing to the database.
