    \kc{} is a web information system that allows different actors to cooperate
    to offer an optimal experience to the karting community.
    Visitors can explore \kc{}, discover tracks and karting centers 
    near to where they live as well as events that tour different tracks and karting centers. When ready
    for their first race, visitors can register as pilots either online or 
    at a nearby karting center. \kc{} enables pilots to organize
    their own races by selecting a track of a karting center, choosing a date 
    and time and listing participating pilots,
    then the system will create a reservation that the clerk of the target karting center
    will confirm. Organizers can create events (an event is a sequence of races that can take
    place on different tracks), they can insert pilots of their choice and they can accept
    applications from pilots that want to participate. Similarly to before, the system 
    will create reservations that the clerks of the karting centers will confirm.
    Karting center administrators can manage their karting centers by adding new
    tracks and go-karts or registering new pilots and clerks.
    Clerks can confirm reservations from pilots and organizers and moderate reviews
    submitted by pilots about karting centers, tracks and events.
    The information system administrator manages \kc{} by creating new karting centers,
    karting center administrators and organizers, he also takes care of all the
    entities that help the visitors to navigate the website, such as cities, categories or ranges 
    useful to filter karting centers, tracks and events.

Description & A race is a competition involving many 
(but it could be just one) pilots that, every time they complete
a lap, generate a lap-time. A race can be created on the spot by
the karting center administrator or a reservation can be made by
a pilot or an organizer, such reservation is then confirmed by a clerk.
The difficulty in handling a race is that it gets first created by
a pilot or an organizer, together with its reservation, and 
during the race different relations are automatically created
with the help of a telemetry system that records the lap-times
of the pilots. \\

it is created automatically when a pilot or an organizer 
makes a reservation and it is later confirmed by a clerk.
When the karting center administrator creates 
a race on the spot, as by February 2024, the associated
reservation is created automatically and connected to a 
fictitious organizer created a priori, then confirmed automatically
by a fictitious clerk created a priori for every karting center.
Further improvements might allow the reservation to be created
without the need of such fictitious instances that only 
cause an overload for the simple sake of not leaving empty fields 
in the reservation. \\

Every race has a best lap-time,
chances that more pilots made lap-times with the same
best time are very low, but in any case the they are both stored
so there is no worry about one of the two being forgotten or not
getting the credit it deserves:
the best lap-time chosen for the race in this case is the one 
that has been made first, in any leaderboard the \textit{discarded}
lap-time can be shown as the first one in the list in case the sorting
policy sorts ties by the name of the pilot or its weight or its age. \\

    In \kc{} the core entities are \textbf{Karting center}, \textbf{Track}, and \textbf{Event},
    the union of each entity with the set of its weak entities forms the core subscheme associated to the core entity. 
    Core entities are accessible one from the other through different paths, the interconnection subschemes
    allow for a fluent navigation between them without the need to go back to the home page.  
    In order to provide a better experience for the user, the core entities are made accessible through
    two other types of subschemes: the visitor will benefit from access subschemes, the registered users will additionally
    benefit from personalization subschemes.

    personalization subscheme, his duty is to manage the system, and with it, all the entities, without
    a specific focus on some instances with respect to others.
    The \textbf{Pilot} is the user with the highest number of personalization subschemes: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item he is the only one able to write the three types of reviews,
        \item he can participate to races (and, as a particular case,
        he has a personalized access to his last race),
        \item for every race he participate to, he has a personalized list of his lap-times (made public, but still

        \item he can apply to events (and, as a particular case, he is accepted to participate
        to an event),

    The \textbf{Organizer} has a personalized access to the reservations he made to create races that are part of his events,
    then he has access to his events, he does not need a personalized access to the applications he received and confirmed
    because all the applications received must have been to one of his events and he is the only one able to accept them,
    so the personalized access to the events is sufficient.\\
    The \textbf{Clerk} has a personalized access to the karting center he works for, all the clerks of a karting center can 
    access the same list of not yet confirmed reservations to a track of the karting center, once a reservation is confirmed, the name of the clerk who confirmed it
    is associated to the reservation, and this the second personalized access of the clerk.\\
    The \textbf{Karting center administrator} has a personalized access to the karting centers he is responsible for.

    The core entities are reachable one from the other through different paths, among which two most important can be identified, which recursively
    contain the other interconnection subschemes:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item the karting center has many tracks (this relationship is already an interconnection subscheme between \textbf{Karting center} and \textbf{Track}),
        and the tracks are the places where the races take place, so when a race is part of an event, the event is connected to different karting centers 
        through the path \textbf{Event} $\rightarrow$ Race $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Track} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Karting center}, this path also allows
        the track to be connected to the event, and this is another interconnection subscheme between \textbf{Event} and \textbf{Track}.
        \item The pilot can participate to different races and events, so e.g. when a visitor is exploring a leaderboard and sees the name of 
        a pilot, he might be interested in knowing more about the events he participated to, and these events might have been hosted by different karting centers 
        from the one that has the track whose leaderboard the visitor was started from. The path \textbf{Karting center} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Track} $\rightarrow$
        Race $\rightarrow$ Pilot $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Event} is the interconnection subscheme between \textbf{Karting center} and \textbf{Event} that can lead from pilot
        that raced in a karting center to other events the pilot participated to, and the inverse path can lead from an event to the pilots that raced in it
        and what other karting centers they raced in.
    \end{itemize}
    There are many different paths that can be followed to also reach different instances from the same entity, the first path is the most \textit{reasonable} and the 
    second is an example of a possible navigation that the visitor might want to follow.

    The access subschemes are the most important for the visitor, they allow him to reach the core entities
    through an exploratory research rather than a lookup search. The visitor is offered a series of filters to reach the core entities,
    the filters are not to be mistaken for weak entities, they are categorization criteria that can be created before even creating
    the core entities. It is worth noticing that among the access subschemes there are some entities that extend the core entities
    (PopularTrack, PopularEvent, ControversialEvent, UpcomingEvent), these should not be considered as real extensions of the core entities 
    as it happens in an object-oriented model, they are to be considered as a materialized view of the database, a stored query that filters out
    many of the instances of the core entities, keeping only those that satisfy a certain condition.

\section{Hypertext model}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Hypertext model}
    The hypertext model is composed of a preliminary phase that produces a coarse hypertext model,
    followed by a detailed phase that produces the detailed hypertext model.
    The second phase is not presented in this report, but a prototype created with the tool \textit{Webratio} will be made available.
\end{frame}

\subsection{Coarse hypertext model}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Coarse hypertext model}
    \tiny
    In addition to the commonly used primitives
    \begin{align*}
        &\text{Core}(\text{core\_entity},\text{component}_1,\dots,\text{component}_N), \\
        &\text{Access}(\text{Core\_entity},\text{access\_entity},\dots,\text{access\_entity}_N), \\
        &\text{Interconnection}(\text{entity}_1, \text{role}_1, \dots, \text{role}_N), \\
        &\text{Personalization}(\text{entity}_1, \text{role}, \dots, \text{role}_N),
    \end{align*}
        and others, we adopt the primitive 
    $$ \text{CoreSub.}(\text{core\_weak\_entity}_1,\dots,\text{core\_weak\_entity}_N) $$
    to represent the focus of a page on the components only of a core entity, without the need to show the core entity itself. \\
    \hfill\\
    Another note: in the following slides the interconnection between an entity and any other entity is not shown unless the interconnection
    coincides with an interconnection subscheme: e.g. in the site view \textit{Public view}, area \textit{Karting center}, the final hypertext model 
    allows the visitor to move from a karting center to its reviews, but this is not shown in the coarse hypertext model, the
    only interconnection shown are from KartingCenter to Event and from KartingCenter to Track.
    Multi-steps paths are not explicitly represented:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item the interconnection \textit{KartingCenter} $\rightarrow$ \textit{Track} $\rightarrow$ \textit{Race} $\rightarrow$ \textit{Event}
    is denoted as a single interconnection between \textit{KartingCenter} and \textit{Event} (and vice versa),
    \item the interconnection \textit{Track} $\rightarrow $ \textit{Race} $\rightarrow$ \textit{Event} is denoted as 
    a single interconnection between \textit{Track} and \textit{Event} (and vice versa).

\section{Future work}
\begin{frame}{Future work}
Explaining the possible improvements to the current work
would take at least as many slides as the ones presented so far,
so here it is mentioned what I consider to be one of the most difficult choice
to make...
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Which are the real weak entities?}
    \scriptsize
    \begin{figure}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{drawio/del-race.png}
        \label{fig:delete-race}
        \caption{The deletion of a race.}
    \end{figure} 
    The deletion of an entity implies the deletion of its weak entities, 
    e.g. the deletion of a karting center implies the deletion of its reviews.
    In many cases there is no need to overthink about what should be deleted together 
    with an entity, e.g. in figure \ref{fig:delete-race} is shown the deletion 
    of a race: its weak entities lap-time and reservation are deleted together with it.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Which are the real weak entities?}
    \scriptsize
    % picture called delete-karting-center.png
    \begin{figure}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{drawio/del-karting-center.png}
        \label{fig:delete-karting-center}
        \caption{The deletion of a karting center.}
    \end{figure}
    Sometimes it is not trivial to choose whether an entity should be the weak
    entity of another one or not, e.g. should or should not the deletion of a karting center
    imply the deletion of its tracks?    
    The choice made in \kc{} is that the deletion of a karting center does 
    not imply the deletion of its tracks (as shown in figure \ref{fig:delete-karting-center}),
    in fact, another karting center could buy the tracks of the karting center being deleted.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Which are the real weak entities?}
    \scriptsize
    % picture called delete-karting-center.png
    \begin{figure}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{drawio/del-track.png}
        \label{fig:delete-track}
        \caption{The deletion of a track.}
    \end{figure}
    The deletion of a track is another example where the choice of what to delete is not obvious:
    a race can happen only if hosted by a track, this leads to the conclusion that the race is a weak entity 
    of the track, but does the deletion of a track really imply the deletion of every information on the races 
    that happened on it? Although as of now the race is a weak entity of the track, in \kc{} (as shown
    in figure \ref{fig:delete-track}) the deletion of a track does 
    not imply the deletion of all the races that happened on it, in fact, 
    keeping the information on how many races happened 
    in the karting center or how the pilots performed compared to each other
    might still be relevant independently of the existence of the track.
    Notice that the deletion of a track still implies the deletion of the other two weak entities, timetable and leaderboard.
    \hfill \\
    Another specific choice made in \kc{} is that the reservation, a weak entity of the race but not of the track, is deleted together 
    with the track because, differently from the race, does not carry relevant information in addition to the race that is kept.
    
    In a future work, it is worth to reconsider the policies on what to delete \textit{in cascade} with the deletion of an entity.
